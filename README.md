## How to Play  Gomoku

* The game is played on a grid (typically 15x15).
* Players take turns placing one of their pieces on an empty intersection of the grid.
* The first player to achieve an unbroken line of **five** of their pieces (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* If the board is filled and no player has achieved five in a row, the game is a draw (though this is rare in standard Gomoku).
